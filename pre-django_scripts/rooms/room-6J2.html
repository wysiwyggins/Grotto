This room is lined with rusting iron spikes. 
You open the door and a puddle of water and a rivulet runs along the wall within which a goblin's bones are tangled. 
Rounded green stones set in the middle of the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you note several metal plates on the floor. 
Their forms are little more than dried husks now, and there's no sign that the only other exit is a tomb. 
Facing stones on the walls and ceiling are nothing but iron grates. </p></section>
