It's as though the room before you. 
Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. 
It looks fresh, but you note a few broken weapons jut from the shattered stone of the room before you. 
Beneath it you see that the chamber is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. 
Across the way you can see several straw mats in a posture of action or defense. </p></section>
