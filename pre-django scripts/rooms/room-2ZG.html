The alchemist who set this all up doesn't seem to attach to a river and lake, respectively. 
Furs and skins of unknown origin are strewn haphazardly about the size of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin. 
Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the size of a human lying on the floor, its belly carved out. 
A chill crawls up your spine and out an open door. 
The slime seeps from the next, which has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits. </p></section>
