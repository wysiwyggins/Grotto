The carving of the room. 
A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a rivulet runs along the walls, and in the ceiling, the extent of which you cannot see plays soothing sounds. 
A huge iron cage lies on the walls and hang from the slain or lie discarded on the floor. 
Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the room ahead. 
Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open. </p></section>
