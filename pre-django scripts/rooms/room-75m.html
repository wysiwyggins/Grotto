Beyond it stands a thick cloud of rock dust. 
The air in the center of the scent: a dark fog. 
Huge niches are set into the wall within which you can discern giant bones. 
The dais has upon it an ironbound chest that has been pulled over its naked breasts. 
This hall stinks with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. </p></section>
