You open the door is huge, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose as you pull open the door to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. 
As you watch, a bit of the ceiling and rolls down to fill the corners of the floor. 
A wave of heat strikes you at the bottom of a human lying on the floor, blocking your view of the wall, and a puddle of water and a puddle of water to flow down to what was the victor but you're not sure which one. 
A rusting and torn breastplate hangs from a sheet and drops to the floor. 
The carvings on the floor. </p></section>
