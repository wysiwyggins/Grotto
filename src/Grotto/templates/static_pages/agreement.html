<p>
Grotto is a minimal platform for creating database-driven online game spaces. It's currently open-source and users are able create their own instances of the software. The creators of this software have applied an <a href="https://anticapitalist.software">anti-capitalist</a> software license that restricts use of this software not just to non-commercial use, but forbids uses that further the exploitation of labor towards profit.
</p>
<p>
Instances of Grotto may have norms and codes of conduct defined by the people who use them. This document that you are reading is a work in progress that defines a code of conduct for the specific instance of Grotto that is running on the wileywiggins.com domain. This instance of the Grotto software does not currently provide ways for players to interact with one another, but features are being added and changed as the underlying code is being developed for a site-specific artwork. Future versions of Grotto may contain names and life details about deceased people in the family of the software designer, as part of an artwork that utilizes the software. Future versions of the Grotto software may allow interactions that could be offensive, such as the symbolic dishonoring of deceased individuals. This is currently not a prohibited interaction. If you have questions about the specific nature of these sorts of symbolic actions, please don't hesitate to contact the email listed on the main grotto page. </p>
<p>
If features are added that allow player-to-player communication, you are expected to refrain from making unwelcome comments to other players in order to continue using the software. Some examples of these sorts of behaviors are:
<ul>
<li> Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices. </li>
<li> Threats, acts, or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm. </li>
<li> Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing"). </li>
<li> Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent. </li>
<li> Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead” or rejected names. </li>
<li> Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate. </li>

<li>Unwelcome sexual attention. Physical contact and simulated physical contact through text (e.g., descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent, or after a request for no contact or to stop. </li>
<li> Deliberate intimidation. </li>
<li> Patterns of inappropriate or unwanted social contact, such as requesting or assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others. Continued one-on-one communication after request to cease. Stalking or unwanted following, whether in-person or online. </li>
</ul>
<p>More details about reporting and consequences for these sorts of behaviors will be added as features that present a potential for player-to-payer harassment or abuse are added.
